# Library

This exercise was tasked to me by CodeClan, Glasgow where I studied towards a PDA Level 8 in Professional Software Development. The exercise brief can be found below.

**Brief**

Create your own library class with an internal collection of books.

**MVP**

- Books should have title, author and genre
- Write a method to count the number of books in the library
- Write a method to add a book to the library stock
- Add a capacity to the library and write a method to check if stock is full before adding a book

**Extensions**

- Add a third class which interacts with the other two
- E.g. you could add a Borrower with a method that takes a Book and moves to the Borrower’s collection

**Advanced Extension**

- The library wants to keep track of it’s number of books by genre. using a HashMap
- Store the genre of each book as the key and a count of how many books of that genre as the value
